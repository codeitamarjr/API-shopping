# API Shopping

API-Shopping it's an API that retrieves the price of goods from local shopping that has an online store option available.
The first one is Tesco(ie).

## Installation

To use this API you'll need [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), after installed you'll need to add the dependencies below:

To check the npm version you can type
```bash
npm -v
```
You'll need the dependence: [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio), [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), and [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
This last one is more for development since the objective is to load the API for every change to the code, if you need to install the dependencies you can just type the command below for each dependence.
```bash
npm install axios
```
